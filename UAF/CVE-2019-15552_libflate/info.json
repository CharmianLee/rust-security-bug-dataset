    "id": "CVE-2019-15551",
    "crate": "smallvec",
    "description": "Attempting to call grow on a spilled SmallVec with a value equal to the current capacity causes it to free the existing data. This performs a double free immediately and may lead to use-after-free on subsequent accesses to the SmallVec contents.\n\nAn attacker that controls the value passed to grow may exploit this flaw to obtain memory contents or gain remote code execution.",
    "bug_type": "Use-After-Free",
