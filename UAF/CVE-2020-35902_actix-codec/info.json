    "id": "CVE-2020-35902",
    "crate": "actix-codec",
    "description": "Affected versions of this crate did not require the buffer wrapped in Framed to be pinned, but treated it as if it had a fixed location in memory. This may result in a use-after-free.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by making the affected functions accept Pin<&mut Self> instead of &mut self.",
